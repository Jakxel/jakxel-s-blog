              <p>Here i share ideas, notes, reflections, and anything that sparks curiosity during my daily experiences, study sessions, and technical explorations.</p>
              <p>I believe that sharing knowledge is one of the best ways to learn and grow. That's why I document my progress here — to clarify my own understanding, keep track of my evolution, and hopefully help or inspire others along the way.</p>
              <p>You'll find here a mix of technical notes, project breakdowns, thoughts, and software engineering insights, all written from my perspective and personal knowledge.</p>
