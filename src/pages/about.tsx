            I'm a Computer Systems Engineering student based in Tijuana, Mexico. I have a strong interest in 
            core Computer Science topics, including algorithms, data structures, operating systems, and software design.

            I'm continuously learning and building personal projects to strengthen my skills. I also explore fields like 
            web development, system design, and low-level programming. My goal is to become a versatile software engineer 
            capable of solving real-world problems through innovation and code.

            Outside of tech, some of my hobbies include reading, playing piano, learning new languages, drawing, meditating, exercising, and sometimes 
            just relaxing with music, anime, or spending time with friends.
